QR code for the URL of the English Wikipedia Mobile main page
A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode[1]) 
invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.
 A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about 
 the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, 
 or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized 
 encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently;
  extensions may also be used.</p>
